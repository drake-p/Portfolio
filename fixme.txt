Doesn't handle browser size less than 960 px - footer is only as wide as the window, Koch image stops being centered, thumbnails spill over
 -> responsive layout -- never have horizontal scrollbar

Slider appears in front of lightbox when page is scrolled upward

Really, really want ESC key to work in lightbox
